# Project_Euler_Solutions

This repo contains my solutions to Project Euler problems.

I know that hundreds if not thousands of people have done this exact thing,
but it serves at a source of motivation and aims to improve my consistency.
It will also help me get familiarized with GitHub and managing projects.

Also, don't judge my code too much. Learning is a proccess ;)
